Map creation requires much less code due to the new SimpleLineMap class.
Added support for barrels.

Dec 14 2003 - 0.4:
Small maps can now be displayed in a "Nethack" format.  For an example, run "path_creation_example.rb -nethack".
Tested with DOOM Legacy (http://sourceforge.net/projects/doomlegacy/) on
Windows, all appears well.

Dec 12 2003 - 0.3:
Added a higher level API - maps can now be generated using expressions like
"e200/s400/w200/n400" which would make a 400 x 200 rectangle.  Note that these
paths need to run clockwise and must be a closed figure with no crossing
lines.
Moved the usage examples into separate files.

Dec 12 2003 - 0.2:
Fixed bug - shorts are no longer decoded as unsigned values.
DOOM primitive wrappers (i.e., Linedefs, Sidedefs) are in place and can be
used to make valid wad files.

Dec 10 2003 - 0.1:
Initial release - mostly wad reading functionality.
Can parse any DOOM 2 wad file into a Ruby object model.
Can change the angle the player is facing and save that change.
