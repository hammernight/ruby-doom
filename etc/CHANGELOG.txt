???? - 0.2:
Fixed bug - shorts are no longer decoded as unsigned values.
DOOM primitive wrappers (i.e., Linedefs, Sidedefs) are in place and can be
used to make valid wad files.

Dec 10 2003 - 0.1:
Initial release - mostly wad reading functionality.
Can parse any DOOM 2 wad file into a Ruby object model.
Can change the angle the player is facing and save that change.
